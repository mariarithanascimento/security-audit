## **Scenario**

*This scenario is based on a fictional company:*

Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, a storefront, and warehouse for their products. However, Botium Toy’s online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide.

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She's worried about maintaining compliance and business operations as the company grows without a clear plan. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).

The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, listing assets currently managed by the IT department, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture.

Your task is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Then, perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist.

### Recommendations

To enhance Botium Toys' security posture and reduce risks to assets, the following control and compliance best practices are recommended for implementation:

1. **Least Privilege Principle**: Ensure users have only the necessary privileges to perform their functions, minimizing exposure to risks.

3. **Password Policies**: Adopt strict password management policies, including complexity requirements, expiration, and prohibition of password reuse.
4. **Separation of Duties**: Implement the separation of critical duties to prevent fraud and errors, ensuring no single person has complete control over all aspects of a transaction or process.
5. **Firewall and IDS**: Install and maintain firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS) to monitor and protect the network against unauthorized access and attacks.
6. **Regular Backups**: Perform regular backups of all critical data and ensure restoration procedures are tested periodically.
7. **Antivirus and Endpoint Security**: Use up-to-date antivirus software and endpoint security solutions to protect against malware and other threats.
8. **Legacy System Monitoring and Maintenance**: Ensure legacy systems are manually monitored and maintained with appropriate interventions to prevent failures.
9. **Encryption**: Implement encryption to protect sensitive data both in transit and at rest, mitigating the risk of data leaks.
10. **Password Management System**: Use a password management system to securely store and manage passwords.
11. **Physical Security**: Ensure offices, storefronts, and warehouses are secured with locks, CCTV surveillance, and fire detection/prevention systems.

### PCI DSS Compliance
